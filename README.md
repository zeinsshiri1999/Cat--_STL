> 😺 "Every cat engineer deserves an elegant C++ experience!"

## 🚀 Technical Highlights

- 🐱 <b>Modern C++20/23</b>: Embracing Concepts, Ranges, Coroutines, and more
- 😸 <b>Ultimate Performance</b>: Low-level optimizations, rivaling or surpassing the standard library
- 😻 <b>Safety</b>: Type and exception safety, always lands on its feet
- 🐈 <b>Developer-Friendly</b>: Clean API, easy to use and extend
- 🐾 <b>Innovative & Experimental</b>: Metaprogramming, generic algorithms, compile-time computation
- 🐅 <b>High-Quality Engineering</b>: Comprehensive tests, automated CI/CD

## 🚀 Technical Vision

Cat++ STL is dedicated to letting every cat engineer write C++ elegantly and play with STL safely.  
We believe a cat's curiosity and independence will make the C++ world more fun!

## 🐾 Introduction

Cat++ STL is a C++20 Standard Template Library as agile as a cat, designed for cat engineers who pursue ultimate performance and elegant design. We embrace modern C++, focus on safety and usability, and aim to provide every cat engineer with an efficient and delightful development experience.

> **Philosophy**: Like a cat—efficient, purposeful, and graceful. Every line of code serves performance and safety, every feature enhances developer experience.

## ✨ Why Cat++ STL?

- <img src="https://storyset.com/illustration/cat-lover/bro" width="24"> **Elegant**: Minimalist design, code as graceful as a cat's walk
- <img src="https://storyset.com/illustration/cat-astronaut/bro" width="24"> **Fast**: Every data structure is as nimble as a cat chasing prey
- <img src="https://storyset.com/illustration/cat-window/bro" width="24"> **Safe**: Cautious like a cat, thoroughly tested for stability
- <img src="https://storyset.com/illustration/cat-typing/bro" width="24"> **Friendly Docs**: Easy for beginners to "pet the cat", efficient for pros
- <img src="https://storyset.com/illustration/cat-astronaut/bro" width="24"> **Community-Driven**: Every contributor is part of the cat family

## 🚀 Quick Start

<img src="https://storyset.com/illustration/cat-typing/bro" width="32" align="left" style="margin-right:10px;">
Just three steps to experience cat-like agility!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Cat-STL.git
cd Cat-STL
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
make install
```

## 🐾 Usage Example

<img src="https://storyset.com/illustration/cat-typing/bro" width="32" align="left" style="margin-right:10px;">

```cpp
#include <cat_stl/vector.hpp>
#include <cat_stl/algorithm.hpp>
#include <cat_stl/concepts.hpp>
#include <iostream>

// Using C++20 concept constraints
template<cat::container T>
void print_container(const T& container) {
    for (const auto& item : container) {
        std::cout << item << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    cat::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    // Using structured bindings and C++20 ranges
    for (auto&& [i, val] : cat::enumerate(vec)) {
        val = val * (i + 1);
    }
    // Using compile-time computation
    constexpr auto sum = cat::static_sum<1, 2, 3, 4, 5>::value;
    std::cout << "Compile-time sum: " << sum << std::endl;
    print_container(vec);
    return 0;
}
```
